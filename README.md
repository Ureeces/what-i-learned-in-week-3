# What I Learned - Week 3
## New Language: Javascript
Javascript is a programming level used in web development

Despite having similar names, Java Javascript don't have much to do with each other 

### Syntax
Here a few of the basic rules for Javascript 

**Declaring Variables**: `let [variable_name] = [value]`

Type `let` before the name declare a variable - This works for strings, floats, and integers

**Declaring Functions**: `function fname(parameters) {}`

To declare a function, type `function` and then your desired name of the function

* **Parameters**: Functions can have parameters, or values that can be passed into them for processing

* **Returning Values**: Though its not required of all functions, you can also return values using `return [value]`
  * **Doing so ends the function at that point, so place it wisely**

**Calling Functions**: `myFunction(var1);`

To call a function, simply type the function followed by parentheses, and then within them, any values you want to pass into the function

**MATH**: `Math.sqrt()`

Like other languages, Javascript also has Math.functions to perform calculations for you

## New Utility Tool: Quokka.js
Quokka is tool in VS Code that displays your output on alongside your code

This really helps with keeping track of variable values and saves some time when wanting to easily know 

To pull it up on VS Code, type Cmd + Shift + P > "Quokka.js" to get a drop down menu and get started!

*It's recommended that you start a new file with Quokka, as for some reason for me at least, you either need pro to use it on another file or it doesn't play nice
